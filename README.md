# House_Data-price-predation
I am first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using home prices dataset from kaggle.com.  Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. During model building and cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning,  outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter  tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 

1) Python 
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 
3) Matplotlib for data visualization 
4) Sklearn for model building 
5) Jupyter notebook and pycharm as IDE 
6) Python flask for http server
